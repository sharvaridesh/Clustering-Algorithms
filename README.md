# Clustering Algorithms

- clustering.py : main code
- cluster.csv : dataset used
- clustering.pdf : report
- DBSCAN_observations : observations other than the optimum result obtained by applying DBSCAN algorithm

## Implementation

- Hierarchical, k-means, and, DBSCAN clustering algorithms are applied separately to the given dataset to check for optimum performance.
- Determination of the better clustering algorithm is done by observing clustering patterns and checking robustness to outliers of each algorithm.
